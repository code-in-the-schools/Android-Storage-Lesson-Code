### Unit 3 Lesson 1 - Storing Data: Shared Preferences

Students will add a preferences screen to their application or create a new project. This preference screen should store the username of the player in Shared Preferences.

You can find the starter code in the folder [Unit3Lesson1A-Starter](./Unit3Lesson1A-Starter/).

We have also included a completed version of the project so that you can use it for reference [Unit3Lesson1A-Finished](./Unit3Lesson1A-Finished/)
